 Diabetics-prediction-system
 
 This project is used to predict whether the patient have a risk of diabetics or not 
 
 Models used :
            Logistic Regression,
            Support Vector Machine,
            Navie Bayes Classifier,
            Decision Tree Classifier,
            Random forst
            
By comparing all the models finnaly,I go with the SVM (which gets better results ) for diabetics prediction
Also,I designed a small tKinter window for GUI interface

OUTPUT : for output run model.py
